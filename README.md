# Hello-World-Letter-Matching-Animation
This Python script simulates a letter-by-letter "brute-force" animation to gradually form the phrase "Hello World!". It cycles through all alphabetic characters and symbols, comparing each guess against the target string. Once a correct character is found at the correct position, it appends it and moves on to the next. This creates a visual effect of the string being "hacked" or "decoded" in real-time.

Features:

Uses time.sleep() to control animation speed.

Demonstrates basic use of strings, loops, and control flow.

A fun beginner project for understanding how iteration and conditionals work.


Run this in a terminal or command-line interface for the best effect.
